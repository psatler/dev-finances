This is a responsive website built with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 
All the transactions you save is store in the browser's local storage.

The project is hosted on Vercel and can be found live at https://dev-finances.psatler.vercel.app/


### Aknowledgements

- Some HTML tags are set to be only visible for screen readers, so they are not displayed for the 
regular user. To hide it without compromising the design, the CSS class `.screen-reader-only` was created. This can be found at the [style.css](style.css) file.
- Meta tags were added via [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/)

#### Dark mode

This was achieved by using two CSS filters: `invert` and `hue-rotate`. More pieces of information can be found at [this link](https://dev.to/akhilarjun/one-line-dark-mode-using-css-24li) and also [this one](https://mwichary.medium.com/dark-theme-in-a-day-3518dde2955a).
